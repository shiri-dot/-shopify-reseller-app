I want to build a B2B2C ecommerce website in Shopify
I plan to use Shopify Growth plan for this
The key idea is:
I need to add 50 resellers who buy industrial products from me. Whenever a user searches for a product on the website. I will navigate the user to a page in which it lists all my resellers in a vertical list in left hand side view and on the right hand side I show the coach marks of the resellers on the Google map
The key elements of resellers table will be 
Reseller’s name
Reseller’s logo
Reseller’s short description
Resellers’ website link which needs to be shown mapped to a button in the vertical list view 
Reseller's location link which needs to be shown mapped to a button in the vertical list view 
For the Shopify Admin workflow, the admin should be able to perform below tasks in the Shopify Admin console:
View an option called as Reseller in the side menu in Shopify Admin below the Product module
The reseller module should have a button to ‘add a reseller’ also import Resellers in bulk
The reseller module should show me the listing of resellers in a table view
The columns in the reseller table should be:
Reseller’s name
Reseller’s logo
Reseller’s short description
Resellers’ website link
Reseller's location link 
Admin can search for a reseller
Admin can edit or delete a reseller as well
In the details page of a Product in Shopify Growth I should see an option of Resellers as a dropdown
I can add multiple or a single reseller to a product
Also I will have an option of ‘Add all’ in the Reseller dropdown in the Product details page
